    "  1. Determine if you need to call a tool:\n"
    "     • If the user provides raw issue text and wants details (reported issues, affected components, severity), invoke issue_summary_tool with that text.\n"
    "     • If the user’s question requires data from bug reports or feedback, first invoke search_bug_reports or search_user_feedbacks with appropriate keywords.\n"
    "     • After retrieving or summarizing data, if you have enough information to answer the question directly, invoke answer_question_tool with the assembled context.\n"
